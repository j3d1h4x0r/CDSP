	# 🧠 Topic 1: Initiate a Data Science Project

Welcome to **Topic 1** of the **Certified Data Science Practitioner (CDSP)** training!
In this module, you'll learn how to kick off a data science project aligned with business goals.

---

## 🌟 Topic Overview

* Data Science as a Business-Enabling Discipline
* Design Thinking in Data Science
* Project Scoping and Specification
* Stakeholder Roles and Management
* Ethics, Security, and Data Access
* Proof of Concept (POC) vs Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Data Governance and Compliance

## 🎯 1. What Is a Data Science Project?

A structured, goal-oriented initiative that applies data-driven methods to solve real-world business problems.

**Key Elements:**

* Data collection and preparation
* Statistical analysis and modeling
* Communication and deployment

**Use Case:**

* A retail chain wants to forecast inventory needs using historical sales data. This requires defining business needs (e.g., reduce stock-outs), collecting store-level data, analyzing seasonal trends, and deploying prediction models to store managers.

**Practical Tip:**
Always start with the **business question**, not the dataset.

---

## 🧠 2. Design Thinking in Data Science

Design thinking helps center the project around user needs.

**3 Main Phases:**

* **Empathy**: Understand the business and user pain points.
* **Define & Ideate**: Frame the problem clearly and brainstorm data-driven solutions.
* **Prototype/Test**: Use data science tools to prototype and test solutions.

**Use Case:**

* A bank wants to improve customer retention. Through empathy interviews, analysts learn customers feel overwhelmed by irrelevant offers. They brainstorm targeted recommendations using past interaction data.

**Practical Tip:**
Use empathy maps and user journey diagrams in early planning.

## 📜 3. Project Scope & Specification

**Project Scope** defines boundaries, timelines, deliverables, and resources.

**Scope Elements:**

* Hardware/software required
* Timeline and milestones
* Team roles
* Success metrics (KPIs)
* Constraints (e.g., budget, legal)

**Specifications** define what the end product will do.

**Example Specification:**

> Build a model that segments customers by churn risk. It must ingest user activity data from the past 6 months, produce daily churn scores, and deploy via dashboard.

**Use Case:**

* In an HR analytics project, scope might include using Python + pandas, with final delivery to the HR team via Tableau dashboards.

**Practical Tip:**
Use a Gantt chart and RACI matrix to visualize tasks and ownership.

## 💼 4. Stakeholders in a Data Science Project

Stakeholders are individuals/groups that impact or are impacted by the project.

**Types:**

* Executives (business value)
* Domain experts (context, accuracy)
* Engineers/IT (integration)
* Customers (user impact)

**Stakeholder Requirements:**

* Reports, dashboards
* Compliance checks
* Feedback on prototypes

**Use Case:**

* In a credit scoring system, stakeholders include:

  * Risk managers
  * Compliance officers (to check fairness)
  * IT for data access
  * End users who interpret the score

**Practical Tip:**
Host regular stakeholder sync meetings; map interests/conflicts in a matrix.

## 🔐 5. Data Security, Privacy & Compliance

**Why it matters:**

* Avoid legal violations
* Protect PII (personally identifiable information)
* Build trust

**Frameworks & Regulations:**

* **GDPR** (EU)
* **HIPAA** (US healthcare)
* **CCPA** (California)
* **PCI DSS** (payment data)

**Practical Examples:**

* Anonymize names, emails before modeling
* Restrict raw data access to analysts only
* Encrypt files in storage and transit

**Use Case:**
A hospital builds a model to predict patient readmissions. All medical data is anonymized, and data usage complies with HIPAA.

---

## 🌐 6. Data Access Control

**Key Concepts:**

* Role-based access (RBAC)
* Principle of least privilege
* IT/data owner coordination

**Questions to Ask:**

* Who owns the data?
* How fresh is it?
* Do we need real-time access?

**Use Case:**
In a churn prediction project, raw telecom data resides in an Oracle DB. The analyst receives a read-only connection string scoped to a pre-cleaned view.

**Practical Tip:**
Log every access. Automate expiry for temporary credentials.

---

## 🔧 7. Proof of Concept (POC) vs Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### 🔢 POC

* Internal
* Limited scope
* Proves feasibility

### 🏋️ MVP

* External
* Limited but usable product
* Validates user value

**Use Case:**

* POC: Train a fraud detection model using 10,000 transactions
* MVP: Deploy the model to detect fraud in live transaction streams for a subset of users

**Practical Tip:**
Don’t polish POCs. Use POCs to explore; use MVPs to iterate.

---

## 🪖 8. Data Governance and Risk Management

**Why it matters:**

* Mitigates legal, ethical, and operational risks
* Enables audit trails and accountability

**Principles:**

* Clear policies for data access, storage, transformation
* Regular audits
* Transparency and explainability

**Use Case:**
In a public sector project, models that recommend service eligibility are reviewed quarterly to ensure they do not introduce bias against vulnerable populations.

**Practical Tip:**
Document transformations and modeling steps for reproducibility.
