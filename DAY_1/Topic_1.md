## 🛠️ Key Concepts

### ✅ What is a Data Science Project?
A structured, goal-driven initiative that uses data to solve business problems and deliver value through insights or predictions.

---

### 🧠 Design Thinking
A human-centered approach to solving problems. In data science, it helps:
- Understand real business needs (empathy)
- Ask the right questions
- Brainstorm solutions before choosing the data/methods

---

### 📋 Project Scope
Defines the **boundaries** of the project:
- Hardware/software resources
- People involved (team/stakeholders)
- Success metrics
- Timeline & deliverables
- Budgetary or technical constraints

> ⚠️ Avoid "Scope Creep": adding unplanned features/tasks that stretch the project beyond its limits.

---

### 📐 Specifications & Objectives
- **Project description** – What are you building and why?
- **Business objectives** – What will success look like?
- **KPIs** – Quantifiable ways to measure success
- **Data availability** – What data do you have or need?
- **Analysis methods** – How will you analyze the data?
- **Testing & deployment** – How will it be validated and used?

---

### 🧑‍💼 Stakeholders
Different types of people involved in or impacted by the project:
- **Internal**: project managers, data scientists, business users
- **External**: customers, partners, regulatory bodies

#### Understand their:
- Requirements
- Concerns
- Communication expectations
- Privacy & compliance expectations

---

### 🧪 Proof of Concept (POC)
> A minimal working example to **prove feasibility**.

Used early in the project to show that an idea or model is worth investing in further.

---

### 🚀 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
> A basic but **usable product** deployed to real users for feedback.

Goal is to validate usefulness and iterate toward a final solution.

---

### 🔐 Data Privacy and Security
You must protect:
- **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)
- **Sensitive business data**
  
Understand applicable policies and laws:
- **GDPR** (EU)
- **HIPAA** (Health data)
- **CCPA** (California)
- **PCI DSS** (Cardholder data)

---

### 🔓 Data Access
Coordinate with IT and data owners to:
- Get permissions
- Justify your need for access
- Define roles and data-handling responsibilities

---

### 📊 Data Governance
Refers to how your organization manages data:
- Ensures data use aligns with strategic goals
- Mitigates risk, especially regarding **privacy** and **bias**
- Supports **voluntary disclosure** and **informed consent**

---
